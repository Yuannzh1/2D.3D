# Discussion on the trajectories of equiangular curves with two fixed points
# You can change 'a' (the distance of the fixed points) and 'degrees' to see different equiangular curves

# If you haven't installed matplotlib and numpy yet, you'll need to do that before running the code. You can use pip, Python's package manager, to install them.
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:
pip install matplotlib numpy
Once you've installed these libraries, you can run the code.
